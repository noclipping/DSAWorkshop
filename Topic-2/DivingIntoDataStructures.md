# 2️⃣ **Diving into Data Structures (25 mins)**

## 🎯 **Objective**:

Explore the basics of Arrays and Linked Lists, demonstrating their operations and significance in dynamic data storage.

## 💻 **Tools Needed**:

- Code editor (e.g., VS Code)
- Web browser with JavaScript console access (e.g., Chrome Developer Tools)

## 📘 **Content Overview**:

This segment will dive into two fundamental data structures used in programming—Arrays and Linked Lists. Participants will learn about the operations possible with each and see why choosing the right data structure is crucial depending on the application needs.

## 📋 **Detailed Breakdown**:

### 📏 **Exploring Arrays (12 mins)**

#### **Introduction to Arrays (3 mins)**

- **Discussion**: What is an Array?
- **Explanation**: Arrays are a collection of elements identified by index, providing a way to store multiple items under a single variable name.

#### **Live Coding: Array Operations in JavaScript (9 mins)**

- **Activity**: Demonstrating common operations such as creation, access, insertion, and deletion.

  - **Code Example**:

    ```javascript
    let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
    console.log(fruits[1]); // Access the second item: Banana

    fruits.push("Dragonfruit"); // Add to the end
    console.log(fruits);

    fruits.splice(2, 0, "Blueberry"); // Insert at third position
    console.log(fruits);

    fruits.pop(); // Remove from the end
    console.log(fruits);
    ```

  - **Explanation**: Discuss how each operation affects the array and its elements, including time complexity aspects (e.g., `push` and `pop` are O(1), while `splice` for insertion can be O(n)).

### 🔗 **Quick Overview of Linked Lists (13 mins)**

#### **What is a Linked List? (3 mins)**

- **Explanation**: Unlike arrays, Linked Lists are a sequence of elements called nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
- **Advantages**: Excellent for dynamic data where the size changes frequently.

#### **Live Demonstration: Implementing a Simple Linked List in JavaScript (10 mins)**

- **Code Example**:

  ```javascript
  class Node {
    constructor(data) {
      this.data = data;
      this.next = null;
    }
  }

  class LinkedList {
    constructor() {
      this.head = null;
    }
    add(data) {
      let newNode = new Node(data);
      if (this.head === null) {
        this.head = newNode;
      } else {
        let current = this.head;
        while (current.next) {
          current = current.next;
        }
        current.next = newNode;
      }
    }
    display() {
      let current = this.head;
      while (current) {
        console.log(current.data);
        current = current.next;
      }
    }
  }

  let list = new LinkedList();
  list.add("Node1");
  list.add("Node2");
  list.add("Node3");
  list.display(); // Output the list items
  ```

- **Explanation**: Show how nodes are added and traversed. Discuss the flexibility linked lists offer over arrays, such as ease of adding or removing elements without reallocating the entire data structure.

### 🚀 **Conclusion (2 mins)**

- **Summary**: Recap the properties of arrays and linked lists and their suitable applications.
- **Encouragement**: Encourage participants to consider these structures when designing their software, to optimize performance and resource utilization.
